# Theater booking system

This project allows users to purchase tickets for 3 plays at a theater, print them, and generate statistics based on sales. 

## Functionalities

- **Buy Tickets**: Users can choose from three plays (Wicked, The Lion King and Auto da Compadecida, by default), available in three shifts, and reserve seats.
- **Choose different areas**: The theater has five distinct areas (Audience A, Audience B, Frieze, Box, and Grand Balcony), each with different prices and seat availability for the user to choose from.
- **Print ticket**: Users can enter their CPF (Brazilian tax ID) and view all the tickets they've purchased.
- **Show stats**: The system provides general sales statistics for the theater as well as individual stats for each play.
- **Export data**: Users can easily export both their bought tickets and the theater's sales statistics to a `.csv` file.
